This is a WIP rasplex installer

Current functionality:
* Will get list of downloads from sourceforge.
* Lets you select one and download.
* That's it!

Wishlist:
1) cross-plattform
2) Allow version selection (stable, testing/bleeding, developer)
3) Allow upgrading to newer versions (not full image install)
4) Backup creation
5) Use offline files
6) RPi config
7) SD device selection (of course)
